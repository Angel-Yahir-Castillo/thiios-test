## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) was an integral part of our development process. We followed the red-green-refactor cycle, writing tests before implementing new features or making changes to existing code. This approach helped us ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.
